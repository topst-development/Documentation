# 1. Introduction
---
The Real-Time Performance Monitor (RTPM) toolkit is a Python-based graphical application designed to monitor and visualize the performance metrics of the AI-G in real time. By connecting a connection between the AI-G board and a Host PC, RTPM facilitates the transmission and analysis of key performance data, including CPU, NPU, memory utilization, and inference times.
 
RTPM operates in two distinct modes:
 
**Injection Mode**: In this mode, the Host PC sends the image data to the AI-G for processing. The AI-G performs inference using its NPU and returns the results to the PC for visualization.
 
**Projection Mode**: In this mode, the AI-G captures images through its connected camera, processes them internally, and transmits the inference results to the RTPM on the host PC.
 
This toolkit is particularly beneficial for developers and engineers aiming to assess and optimize the performance of AI applications on the AI-G platform. It provides real-time insights into system behavior, enabling efficient debugging and performance tuning.
 
For detailed setup instructions and usage guidelines, refer to the subsequent sections of this document.

Images, NPU, CPU, and MEM performance acquired from AI-G can
be delivered to the PC through Vision Protocol, and results can be found
in the RTPM toolkit on the PC.

## 2.1 Performance Monitoring
 
The Real-Time Performance Monitoring Toolkit (RTPM) is a GUI-based tool developed
by using Python that monitors the output of the AI-G in a PC environment
and allows you to check CPU, NPU, and Memory Performance data.
 
 
 
**Table 2.1 Performance data lists of RTPM:**
 
|   No   |  Performance Data    |                Description             |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1      | Inference Time       | Inference time for each model (ms)     |
| 2      | NPU Utilization      | NPU utilization for each model         |
| 3      | FPS                  | FPS information based on NPU operation |
| 4      | CPU                  | CPU utilization (500 ms cycle)         |
| 5      | Memory               | Memory utilization (500 ms cycle)      |
