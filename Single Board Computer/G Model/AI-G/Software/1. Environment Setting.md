# 2. Setting Host Environment (Windows)
This chapter provides instructions on how to set up the host PC environment, with separate guides for setting up on Windows PC and Ubuntu PC.
<br>

## 2.1 Windows Environment 
This document provides instructions on how to set up WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to use Linux on a Windows PC.
Since TOPST AI-G Linux SDK is based on the Yocto Project, Linux version of TOPST AI-G SDK follows the Yocto project.
You can install another version of Linux, but in this document, TOPST AI-G Linux SDK is described based on Ubuntu 22.04.
If the host OS is Ubuntu, please proceed to Section 2.2.
</br>

### 2.1.1 Install WSL2 Ubuntu 

1. Excute Windows PowerShell with "**Run with administrator privileges**"
2. Enable the WSL2 System.
    ```
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
    ```
3. Enable the Virtual Machine feature.
    ```
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
    ```
4. Set WSL 2 to the default version
    ```
    wsl --set-default-version 2
    ```
5. Search for Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS in Microsoft Store and download it.

    * If you need to download the Linux kernel update package, download the latest package [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/ko-kr/windows/wsl/install-manual).

6. You may choose any user name during the Ubuntu installation

<br/><br/>


### 2.1.2 Accessing Ubuntu via WSL2
Open the Windows Command Prompt and enter the following command to access Ubuntu. When you access Ubuntu, it starts in the /mnt/c/Users/[user name] directory by default.
```
wsl  // access ubuntu 
ls   // check contents in your directory
```

$ sudo apt-get install -y iputils-ping python3-git python3-jinja2 libegl1-mesa libsdl1.2-dev pylint

$ sudo apt-get install -y xterm zstd ncftp curl git-lfs vim zip
```

<br/>

### 2.1.5 Install Repo

You can download TOPST AI-G SDK through Android Repo.  
To install Repo, refer to the following website: https://source.android.com/source/downloading.html.  
If Repo is already installed, you can use it without re-installing.  
Before installing Repo, the installed Python version (3.6 or higher) should be properly set.

Use the following command to install repo.
```
$ sudo apt-get install repo
```

If you see the error messange '/usr/bin/env 'python' no such file or directory', use the following command that allows the file 'python' to point to 'python3'.

```
$ sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
```
If there is a Repo error, Use the following command to download the latest version and put it directly into the /usr/bin/ folder.

```
$ mkdir -p ~/bin

$ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo

$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

$ sudo mv ~/bin/repo /usr/bin/repo
```
Please proceed to **Chapter 3: Image Build Guide**.

Please proceed to **Chapter 3: Image Build Guide**.

<br/><br/>


# 3. Image Build Guide
This section provides guidance based on the Ubuntu OS installed on the host PC (regardless of whether it is WSL or a local Ubuntu installation). The image to be uploaded to the AI-G is built using the Yocto Project, and therefore the process must be carried out in the Ubuntu environment.

<br/>

## 3.1 SDK Build Prepration

TOPST AI-G SDK is based on Yocto Project 4.0 kirkstone. Therefore, the Yocto Project environment must be set on the host PC to use TOPST AI-G SDK. To download SDK, source-mirror, and tools, you must install utilities. To build the image smoothly, the user's PC must have **at least 60 GB of available storage** and **a minimum of 16 GB of RAM**.

<br/>

## 3.2 Yocto Project

The Yocto Project is an open-source project that focuses on embedded Linux development. 
It uses a combination of Poky, which is a part of the Open Embedded project, and bitbake as the build system to make Linux images. 
By using Yocto Project, you can simultaneously build the bootloader, kernel, and rootfs. 

<br/>

## 3.3 Task Process of Yocto Project

Figure 3.1 shows the task process of the Yocto Project. You can download the source code from upstream repositories based on metadata and then build it. After the build is completed, package, image, and SDK are provided as results. 


<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topst-development/Documentation/refs/heads/main/Assets/TOPST%20AI-G/Software/Linux%20SDK/2.%20Yocto%20Project.png" ></p>

## 4.3 Ready to Download FWDN
Before executing FWDN, you must first transfer the image and FWDN tool you created after the build from Ubuntu (WSL2) to the Windows Environment. 

1. Unzip "output_nd.fwdn.zip"
```
$ cd ~/topst-sdk/ && \ 
$ mkdir images && \ 
$ mv ./output_nd.fwdn.zip ./images && \ 
$ cd images && \ 
$ unzip output_nd.fwdn.zip &&
```

2. Copy "images" folder to Windows C drive. 
```
$ cd .. && \ 
$ cp -r ./images /mnt/c/ 
```
<br/>

## 4.4 FWDN in Windows Environment
1. Execute Windows PowerShell and go to “C:\images”.  
```
$ cd C:\images 
```
2. Enter .\fwdn_nd.bat command to start the firmware download. The “fwdn_nd.bat” is an executable file that automatically downloads firmware by using FWDN V8. 

```
./fwdn_nd.bat
```

<br/>

## 4.5 Execute FWDN in Linux Environment 

In a Linux environment, you can download TOPST AI-G image by entering the following command. 

```
./fwdn.sh 
```
After FWDN is completed, remove the USB Type-C cable from the FWDN port and remove the power cable.
