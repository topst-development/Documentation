# 1. Introduction
The Real-Time Performance Monitoring (RTPM) toolkit is a Python-based graphical application designed to monitor and visualize the performance metrics of the TOPST AI-G board in real time. By establishing a connection between the AI-G board and a host PC, RTPM facilitates the transmission and analysis of key performance data, including CPU, NPU, memory utilization, and inference times.

RTPM operates in two distinct modes:

**Injection Mode**: In this mode, the host PC sends image data to the AI-G board for processing. The board performs inference using its NPU and returns the results to the PC for visualization.

**Projection Mode**: Here, the AI-G board captures images via its connected camera, processes them internally, and transmits the inference results to the RTPM on the host PC.

This toolkit is particularly beneficial for developers and engineers aiming to assess and optimize the performance of AI applications on the TOPST AI-G platform. It provides real-time insights into system behavior, enabling efficient debugging and performance tuning.

For detailed setup instructions and usage guidelines, please refer to the subsequent sections of this document.

Images, NPU, CPU, and MEM performance acquired from TOPST AI-G Board can
be delivered to the PC through Vision Protocol, and results can be found
in the RTPM toolkit on the PC.

## 2.1 Performance Monitoring

The Real-Time Performance Toolkit (RTPM) is a GUI-based tool developed
by Python that monitors the output of the TOPST AI-G in a PC environment
and allows you to check CPU, NPU, and Memory Performance data.

<br/>

**Table 2.1 Performance data lists of RTPM:**

|   No   |  Performance Data    |                Description             |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1      | Inference Time       | Inference time for each model (ms)     |
| 2      | NPU                  | NPU utilization by each model          |
| 3      | FPS                  | Fps information based on NPU operation |
| 4      | CPU                  | CPU utilization (500ms cycle)          |
| 5      | Memory               | Memory utilization (500ms cycle)       |

## 2.2 Injection Mode

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topst-development/Documentation/refs/heads/main/Assets/TOPST%20AI-G/Software/NPU%20development/RTPM/3.%20Injection%20Mode.png"></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Figure 3 Injection Mode</strong></p>

Injection Mode is a scenario in which the TOPST AI-G board receives an
image from the RTPM and then NPU Inference on TOPST AI-G Board and sends
the result back to the RTPM.

<br/><br/>

## 2.3 Projection Mode
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topst-development/Documentation/refs/heads/main/Assets/TOPST%20AI-G/Software/NPU%20development/RTPM/4.%20Projection%20Mode.png"></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Figure 4 Projection Mode</strong></p>

Projection Mode is a scenario in which the board receives an image through the camera and sends the final result (the composite image of the box) to the RTPM.
