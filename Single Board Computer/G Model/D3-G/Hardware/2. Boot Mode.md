# 1. Introduction

This page describes the boot modes supported by the D3-G.

# 2. Boot Modes in D3-G

TOPST D3-G board supports three boot modes: 
- USB Boot Mode (FWDN) 
- eMMC Boot Mode (GPIO_SD0 Group)  
- SNOR and eMMC Boot Mode (Option) 

Figure 2.1 shows the location of Boot Mode resistors on the TOPST D3-G board. The resistors are located on the bottom of the board. The TOPST D3-G board is fixed to eMMC Boot Mode by default. If there is no boot image in the eMMC device, the Boot Mode is automatically switched to USB Boot Mode.

## 2.1 USB Boot Mode (FWDN) 
Figure 2.2 shows the Boot Mode switch and RESET switch. USB Boot Mode is used for firmware updates. To enter FWDN mode, both Boot mode switch and RESET switch are required, and we recommend using this method when uploading the image.

The following steps describes the switch operation for entering USB Boot Mode. 
1. When power is supplied, the LED above the RESET switch turns on. 
2. Press and hold the Boot Mode switch. When you press the Boot Mode switch, you can see the RED Light above switch. Keep pressing the switch to keep the LED on. 
3. The RESET switch LED is green by default. Press the RESET switch once, then the green LED turns off and then turns on again. 
4. Release the Boot Mode switch. 

Figure 2.3 shows the operation sequence of the Boot Mode and RESET switches for entering USB Boot Mode (FWDN).

## 2.2 SNOR and eMMC Boot Mode 
SNOR and eMMC Boot Mode is optional. To use this boot mode, the SNOR IC must be mounted on the board, and the SMT of boot mode resistors must be changed. 
Figure 2.4 shows the required changes for using SNOR and eMMC Boot Mode.
