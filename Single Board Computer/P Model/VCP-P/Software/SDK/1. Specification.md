## 1.3 Toolchain Overview  

For effective development on the TOPST-VCP board, it is crucial to have the right toolchain in place. This guide specifically recommends the use of gcc-linaro-7.2.1-2017.11-x86_64_arm-eabi for cross-compilation. This toolchain is not only compatible with the ARM Cortex-R5 architecture but also provides a suite of tools optimized for the TCC7045 chip.
