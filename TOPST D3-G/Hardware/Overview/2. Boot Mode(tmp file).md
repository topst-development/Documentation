# Boot Modes in D3-G

TOPST D3-G board supports three boot modes: 
- USB Boot Mode (FWDN) 
- eMMC Boot Mode (GPIO_SD0 Group)  
- SNOR and eMMC Boot Mode (Option) 

Figure 2.6 shows the location of Boot Mode resistors on the TOPST D3-G board. The resistors are located on the bottom of the board. The TOPST D3-G board is fixed to eMMC Boot Mode by default. If there is no boot image in the eMMC device, the Boot Mode is automatically switched to USB Boot Mode.
