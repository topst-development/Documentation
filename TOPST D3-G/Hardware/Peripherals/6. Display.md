# 6. DisplayPort Connector

The TOPST D3 has one DisplayPort that supports DP 1.4 with resolution up to 4Kp60.  


Figure 6.1 shows how to enable the display using DisplayPort on TOPST-D3. If you want to connect to another Display Devices that only support HDMI, you can use DP to HDMI converting cables.
