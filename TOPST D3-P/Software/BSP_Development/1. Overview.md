## 1.1 Functional Block Diagram

The TCC8050 provides a range of solutions such as Car Audio Video Navigation (AVN), Digital Cluster, and Around View Monitor (AVM). The TCC8050 integrates the ARM® Cortex-A72 multi-core processor as well as Cortex-A53 multi-core processor, Cortex-R5 for microprocessor, SC000 core of Hardware Security Module (HSM) in Security sub-system for automotive security, Cortex-M4 for storage management, another Cortex-M4 for TSDEMUX in Cortex-M4 sub-system, and hardwired Video Processing Unit (VPU)/Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to maximize multimedia experience at its peak level. The hardwired VPU enables video encoding and decoding, and the GPU offers 3D graphic with OpenGL ES1.1/2.0/3.2 and OpenCL 1.0/1.1/2.0. The TCC8050 supports various operation systems such as Linux® and Android™.

The TCC8050 is an optimized processor for network devices which require the ease of connectivity functions: The USB 3.0, USB 2.0 Device/Host and USB 2.0 Host controllers enable the data transmission between the multimedia devices and storage devices. The Ethernet MAC controller provides internet connection that is compliant to IEEE802.3 standard. Also, PCI Express (PCIe) Gen 3 provides high bandwidth for external IP interconnection.

This innovative and rich feature set expands the categories of application that can be used with TCC8050 to meet evolving technology and market needs.
