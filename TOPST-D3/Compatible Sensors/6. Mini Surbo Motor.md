# 6. Mini Surbo Motor (SG-90)
* Power supply for 4.8V
* Stall torque : 1.8kg/cm(4.8)

The following code is an example code that rotates 180 degrees in different directions every two seconds.
```
import time
 
PWM_PIN = 1
PWM_PATH = f'/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm{PWM_PIN}'
 
def write_pwm_file(file, value):
    with open(f'{PWM_PATH}/{file}', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(value))

    try:
        with open('/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/export', 'w') as f:
            f.write(str(PWM_PIN))
    except IOError:
        pass
 
    write_pwm_file('period', 20000000)

    write_pwm_file('enable', 1)
 
def set_angle(angle):
    pulse_width = 1000000 + (angle / 180.0) * 1000000

        time.sleep(2)
 
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("finish the program")
 
finally:
