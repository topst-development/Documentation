# GPIO Example

GPIO(general-purpose input/output) is a digital signal pin on an
integrated circuit or electrical circuit board that allows the
operation, including input or output, to be controlled by the user at
runtime.

GPIO is not predefined for a specific purpose and is not used by
default.

GPIO is implemented by an assembly-level circuit network designer
(circuit board designer for integrated circuit GPIO, system integrator
for substrate-level GPIO, S/I) whose purpose and behavior are defined
when used.

The functions that GPIO performs may vary depending on the system, and
the functions that are generally provided are as follows.

- Input/output function (high=1, low=0)

- IRQ signal detection: This can also be used to wake up system in
  suspend state on Power management mode.

- Can be accessed even when Spinlock is jammed

  The above functions allow you to use the write protection, control
  LEDs, enable transceiver settings, hardware watchdog functions, or
  switch sensing.

  The following is an example of testing the input and output of the
  board. You can test the input and output by controlling the pin number
  by referring to the Raspberry Pi pin map.

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>$ echo "90" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export</p>

<p>$ echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio90/value</p></td>
