# BOOTING GUIDE

This chapter describes how to boot the TOPST AI and log in to the for
each core.

## Booting Sequence

The booting sequence is as follows:

1.  Connect the MIPI interface panel.

2.  Connect the MIPI interface camera module.

3.  Connect USB C to A Cable to the debug port.

4.  Connect the 5V Power.

## TOPST AI Connection with UART

To perform USB debugging and develop Linux environment, you can access
the core (CA53) by using the

TOPST AI debug port in board shown below.

Install the UART Bridge VCP driver (found on
https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)
on the host PC.

Afterwards, when you connect the UART to the TOPST debugging board, the
CP210x USB to UART driver is set up as follows.

Figure 1.2 USB Connection in Windows Environment

Connect UART port by using the terminal emulator on the host PC.

Shown below is the log screen that was booted by connecting to the core.

**Example**

- Terminal emulator: PuTTY or mobaXterm

- Speed: 115200 bps

- Data bits: 8

- Parity: None

- Stop bits: 1

- Flow Control: None
