# 4. Tact Switch (SW1, SW4, SW6)


The TOPST VCP has three tact switches for PORN (SW1), ADC01 (SW4), KEY0 (SW6).  

Figure 4.1 shows the location of the tact switch (SW1).

## 4.1 Tact Switch (SW1)  
SW1 is a tact switch to reset the power block and system block in Main Processor Unit, TCC7045. The function of this button is as follows:  
- Pressing the tack switch (SW1) in the power on state forces the power block to reset and the system of the TCC7045 to restart.
-  Be careful when pressing the tack switch as the power may suddenly turn off and data may be corrupted.

## 4.2 Tact Switch (SW4, SW6)
SW4, SW6 is a tact switch to input a low signal in Main Processor Unit, TCC7045. The function of this button is as follows:  
- Pressing the tack switch (SW4, SW6) inputs a low signal to ADC or GPIO port of the TCC7045.
- This allows that multiple operations may be executed.
