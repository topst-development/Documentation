# 1. TOPST VCP Arduino Introduction 

Welcome to the TOPST VCP Arduino project! This repository is dedicated to creating an Arduino software package for the TOPST VCP, based on the Telechips TCC7045, a sophisticated Vehicle Control Processor (VCP). Our goal is to provide a development environment that parallels the simplicity and flexibility of Arduino, specifically tailored for automotive semiconductors.

<br/><br/>

## 1.1 About TOPST VCP 
TOPST VCP is a powerful, efficient processor designed for automotive applications. By integrating this with the Arduino environment, we aim to simplify and expedite the development process in the automotive sector.

<br/><br/>

## 1.2 Project Components 
This project consists of three main components:
1. **TOPST VCP Bootloader for Arduino**: A custom bootloader allowing Arduino sketches to run on the TOPST VCP.
2. **Arduino Core**: The core Arduino software, modified to support the TOPST VCP.
3. **Libraries Ported to TOPST VCP**: A set of libraries adapted to utilize the full capabilities of the TOPST VCP in various applications.

<br/><br/>

## 1.3 Development Environment 
The TOPST VCP Arduino project enables developers to write software in the familiar Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and directly run it on the TOPST VCP. This approach simplifies the development process, making it more accessible to a broader range of developers.

<br/><br/>

## 1.4 Open Source and Collaboration 
Maintained by the TOPST Alliance, this project is open-source, and we encourage collaboration and participation from the community. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a hobbyist, your contributions are valuable to us.

<br/><br/>

## 1.5 Getting Started 
- **Installation**: Instructions on how to set up the development environment.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on how to use the TOPST VCP Arduino, including examples and tutorials.
- **Contributing**: Guidelines on how to contribute to the project.
