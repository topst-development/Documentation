# 3. Environment Setting

Successfully developing for the TOPST-VCP board requires a well-structured development environment. This chapter will guide you through the necessary steps to set up your Ubuntu 22.04 system with all the essential tools, utilities, and software packages.

<br/><br/>

## 3.1 Installing Essential Tools and Utilities

Before diving into the specifics of the TOPST-VCP board, it's crucial to have some basic utilities and tools installed. These tools serve as the foundation upon which other software and configurations will be built.

1. **Terminal** : Ubuntu 22.04 comes with a built-in terminal. Familiarize yourself with its usage, as many of the following steps will require terminal commands.
2. **Text Editor**: While Ubuntu comes with a basic text editor, you might want to consider installing more robust editors such as “nano”, “vim” or graphical ones like “gedit” or “VSCode” based on your preference.
3. **SSH Tools** : Remote access to other systems or devices, especially the TOPST- VCP board, can be essential during development. Various SSH tools can facilitate this:
4. **Putty** : A popular, free, and open-source terminal emulator that supports SSH, among other protocols. It's lightweight and easy to use.
5. **Tera Term** : An open-source terminal emulator that's more feature-rich and provides extensive support for various communication protocols, including SSH.
6. **Secure CRT** : A commercial product known for its robustness and advanced features. It's a go-to choice for professionals seeking a comprehensive SSH tool with extensive session management capabilities.

Depending on your specific needs and preferences, you can choose one or more of these tools for SSH access.  

**For your reference, this guide document use putty.**

## 3.2 Installing Software Using apt

The “apt” package manager is a powerful tool in Ubuntu, allowing you to install, update, and manage software packages with ease.

### 3.2.1 Updating the package list

Before installing any new software, it's a good practice to update the list of available packages. This ensures you're getting the latest versions and dependencies.

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

This command fetches the latest list of available packages from the repositories.
