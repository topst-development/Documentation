#  5. Obtaining the Source Code

The source code forms the backbone of any development project. It contains all the necessary files, configurations, and instructions required to build and run software for a specific platform. In the context of the TOPST-VCP board, obtaining the correct source code is crucial to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.

This chapter will guide you through the process of fetching the source code using git, a widely-used version control system.

<br/><br/>

## 5.1 Cloning the TOPST-VCP Source Code

To obtain the source code for the TOPST-VCP board, you'll be using the git clone command. This command creates a copy of the remote repository on your local machine, allowing you to work with the code directly.

Follow these steps to clone the TOPST-VCP source code:

1. **Open Terminal** : Launch the terminal application on your Ubuntu 22.04 system.
2. **Navigate to Desired Directory** : Choose a suitable location on your system where you'd like to save the source code. For instance, if you'd like to save it in the user home directory, use the command

    ```
    $ cd ~
    ```

## 5.2 Familiarizing with the Source Code Structure

After cloning, it's beneficial to familiarize yourself with the directory structure and contents of the source code. This will give you a better understanding of where specific files are located and how the codebase is organized.

- Use commands like ls to list the contents of directories.
- Explore key directories and files to understand their purpose and functionality.

```
$ ls -al
```
