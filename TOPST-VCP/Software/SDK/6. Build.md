#  6. Building the Source Code

With the source code successfully obtained, the next critical step is to build it, ensuring it's tailored to run optimally on the TOPST-VCP board.

<br/><br/>

## 6.1 Understanding Makefiles and Build Systems

A Makefile is a cornerstone of many build systems. It contains rules and directives that tell the make utility how to compile and link a program. By utilizing Makefiles, developers can automate the build process, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

<br/><br/>

## 6.2 Initiating the Build Process

To start building the source code, follow these steps :

1. **Use the following command to navigate to the Build Directory :**

    ```
    $ cd build/tcc70xx/gcc/
    ```

2. **Use the following command to run the make command :**

    ```
    $ make
    ```

This command reads the Makefile in the current directory and executes the build process.

3. **Verify the Build Output** : Once the build process is complete, you should find the following output files on the terminal
    - output/tcc70xx_pflash_boot.rom
    - output/tcc70xx_pflash_boot_2M_ECC.rom
    - output/tcc70xx_pflash_boot_3M_ECC.rom
    - output/tcc70xx_pflash_boot_4M_ECC.rom

    Ensure these files are present as they'll be crucial for the next stages of development.

    To make sure all output files, use the following command :   
    
    ```
    $ ls output/ -al
    ```
