# MIPI CSI 5 MP Camera
---

Professional-grade camera module designed for embedded vision, automotive, and industrial applications.
This compact camera module integrates a 5 MP OV5645 image sensor with high-quality lens optics (Figure 1). Offering wide field-of-view and excellent image performance, it is optimized for embedded vision systems such as ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), robotics, machine vision, and real-time image processing applications. The module supports multiple video modes and operates reliably across a wide temperature range, making it ideal for automotive and industrial environments.

**Note:** Component availability and configurations are provided on a made-to-order basis depending on specific project requirements.
